Hello World :earth_asia:

This is my first post, hoping there's a lot more I can write, but for now, this is me getting started with blogging.

I am an experienced Software Developer from the UK. I started my first fulltime job in 2011, I never thought to share my thoughts & experience. Through this blog, I am hoping to channel my thoughts and hopefully pay forward the knowledge in the same way I've found to be useful from other bloggers.

For now, I have a lot to learn about GitHub pages but I shall be adding more content over the coming future.

Stay tuned. :warning: :construction:
